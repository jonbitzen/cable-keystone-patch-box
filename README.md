# Cable Keystone Patch Box

A cable patchbox that uses standard wall-jack keystones for desk mounting.  The original intent of this design was to connect PC's and peripherals to the patch boxes using short cables, and then route the cables with fixed wiring underneath the desk.  That way you can reduce cable messs on your desk, as well as easily change out the PCs at various stations.  Other uses are possible.
